# Meta Learning Not to Learn

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the regression exepriments presented in the paper. Most of the code modifications are as follows: 
- NuRD dataset class added
- Significant changes to training loop in train_reweighting.py as well
- A few models added to models.py (formerly INP.py) 

## Synthetic Data
`jobs/run_nurd.sh` contains commands that need to be run to reproduce the experiments with synthetic data.
